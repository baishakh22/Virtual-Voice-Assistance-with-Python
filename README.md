# Virtual-Voice-Assistance-with-Python
Here I'm creating a virtual voice assistance like alexa, siri or google assistance. I named as 'Maya' which is Greek name means water. For code editor I'm going to use PyCharm community version. After I installed it I can named as i want. I named it as virtual assistance. 

Before I start I need to install some package.
First I will install speechRecognition package which help python to under my voice.
```
pip install SpeechRecognition
```
Then whatever 'Maya' found something for me it will talk. That's why i need a package which helps Maya to talk
```
pip install pyttsx3
```

Then I need a install pyaudio which run audio in my system. To install this package, sometimes it can't install. So if you make your Python version lesst than 3.6 then it might work. However, I used 
```
pip install Flask
```
```
virtualenv flask
```
then I install my PyAudio package. 
```
pip install PyAudio
```
If it still a issue for any of you can shoot me an email to 'baisahkmuhfat@yahoo.com'

Now everthing should work. 
In this module this is not a crazy project. It willl response with limited command. Like, today's date, day, month, year. It also play music from youtube, search information from wikipedia, send messgage to whatsapp, tell me the jokes, weather update, set up an alarm and some basic command. Here, if my program can't help to search then it will pass to google search, which I added in else statement. 
Here are the list of package I was need to install
```
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install Flask
virtualenv flask
pip install PyAudio
pip install pywhatkit
pip install wikipedia
pip install pyjokes
pip install python-weather

```
