# Virtual-Voice-Assistance-with-Python
Here I'm creating a virtual voice assistance like alexa, siri or google assistance. I named as 'Maya' which is Greek name means water. For code editor I'm going to use PyCharm community version. After I installed it I can named as i want. I named it as virtual assistance. 

Before I start I need to install some package.
First I will install speechRecognition package which help python to understand my voice.
```
pip install SpeechRecognition
```
Then whatever 'Maya' found something for me it will talk. That's why i need a package which helps Maya to talk
```
pip install pyttsx3
```

Now install PyAudio package. 
```
pip install PyAudio
```
To install PyAudio package, sometimes it can't install. So if you make your Python version less than 3.6 then it might work. However, I used this command in my windows, that solve my issue.

```
pip install pipwin
pipwin install PyAudio
```
As I install in windows that why I used pipwin install PyAudio. If you using this in your macbook m1, then try this (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68251169/unable-to-install-pyaudio-on-m1-mac-portaudio-already-installed) documentation that might solve your issue.  

Still if are facing same issue, you can shoot me an email to 'baisahkmuhfat@yahoo.com'

Now everything should work. 
In this module this is not a crazy project. It will response with limited command. Like, today's date, day, month, year. It also play music from YouTube, search information from Wikipedia, send message to WhatsApp, tell me the jokes, weather update, set up an alarm and some basic command. Here, if my program can't help to search then it will pass to google search, which I added in else statement. 
Here are the list of package I was need to install
```
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install PyAudio
pip install pywhatkit
pip install wikipedia
pip install pyjokes
pip install python-weather
pip install Flask
```
